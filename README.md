### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of CSS Flexbox for centering elements and creating responsive layouts. I also learned how to properly structure a card component with semantic HTML.

Some key CSS techniques I implemented:

```css
/* Centering the card both vertically and horizontally */
body {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Creating a clean card layout with proper spacing */
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 450px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 5%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
